# Markdown Rule

This rule defines guidelines for working with Markdown files in the MCP Home Assistant Server project.

## Formatting Requirements

- Always format Markdown files using Prettier:
  ```bash
  npx prettier -c -w .
  ```

## Style Guidelines

- Do not use bold formatting (double asterisks `**`) in Markdown files
- Use alternative emphasis methods when needed:
  - Section headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) for structural emphasis
  - Lists and indentation for organizing content
  - Code blocks for technical content
  - Inline code formatting (backticks) for references

## Application

This rule applies to all Markdown files in the project, including:
- README.md
- Documentation files
- TODO.md
- Any other .md files

The markdown.mdc rule helps ensure consistent document formatting across the project.
