# Todo Rule

This rule defines guidelines for working with TODO items in the MCP Home Assistant Server project.

## Format Requirements

- All TODO items should be written in markdown format using checkboxes
- Each TODO item should be maximum 72 characters long
- Use `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Group related tasks under appropriate headers with ## or ### markdown syntax
- Keep task descriptions concise but clear - summarize the task efficiently
- Tasks should be ordered by dependency (items that depend on others come later)

## Structure

TODO lists should be structured as follows:

```markdown
# Project Name - TODO List

## Main Category

- [ ] Task 1 description (max 72 chars)
- [ ] Task 2 description (max 72 chars)

### Subcategory

- [ ] More specific task 1
- [ ] More specific task 2
```

## Complexity Guidelines

- Each task should represent a single unit of work
- Complex tasks should be broken down into subtasks
- If a task requires multiple steps, create a subtask list beneath it
- Avoid overly technical language in task descriptions

## Interaction Rules

When working with TODOs:

1. Always maintain the maximum 72 character limit per task
2. Keep the hierarchical structure intact
3. Group similar tasks together under appropriate headers
4. Mark tasks as complete with `- [x]` syntax when finished
5. Do not delete completed tasks (mark them complete instead)
6. Add new tasks at the appropriate section, not just at the end

## Formatting

Use Prettier to maintain consistent formatting:
```bash
npx prettier -c -w TODO.md
```

The todo.mdc rule helps ensure consistent TODO management across the project.
